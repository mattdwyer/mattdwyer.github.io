He received his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2011 and 2017. His research interests lie in the design, simulation, and fabrication of nonlinear transmission line (NLTL) monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs). He has designed faster and higher voltage gallium arsenide (GaAs) Schottky diode varactors to enable the generation of sub-picosecond voltage waveforms. He has also developed cleanroom fabrication processes to enable MMICs with reduced parasitics and losses. This cleanroom experience has also led to the development of many tools to support manual wafer and piece processing.\n","location":{"address":"1415 Engineering Dr, EH1335","postalCode":"WI 53706","city":"Madison","countryCode":"US","region":"Wisconsin"},"profiles":[{"network":"ResearchGate","username":"ResearchGate","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Matt_Dwyer"},{"network":"LinkedIn","username":"mmdwyer","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mmdwyer/"}]},"work":[{"company":"van der Weide Group","position":"Postdoc","website":"https://vdw.ece.wisc.edu/","startDate":"2017-06-01","endDate":"","summary":"NLTLs and self-assembled helices.\n","highlights":["Self-assembled gold/semiconductor helices","NLTL design/fabrication for freespace THz TDS"]},{"company":"Hai Lab","position":"Postdoc","website":"https://hailab.wisc.edu/","startDate":"2019-06-01","endDate":"","summary":"ISFETs and resonators.\n","highlights":["ISFET design/fabrication for biology applications","LC resonator design/fabrication"]},{"company":"Cleanroom Labware","position":"Founder","website":"https://cleanroomlabware.com/","startDate":"2017-06-01","endDate":"","summary":"Cleanroom labware designs and manufactures PTFE labware for university-scale cleanroom wafer and piece processing.\n","highlights":["Used by majority of groups at UW-Madison's Nanoscale Fabrication Center.","Sponsor of UW-Madison's Facilities Day Open House."]}],"education":[{"institution":"University of Wisconsin-Madison","area":"Electrical Engineering","studyType":"PhD","startDate":"2011-06-01","endDate":"2017-06-01","gpa":"4.0","courses":["Thesis: 'Ultrafast high-voltage Schottky varactors for nonlinear transmission line terahertz generation, detection and sensing.'"]},{"institution":"University of Wisconsin-Madison","area":"Electrical Engineering","studyType":"Masters","startDate":"2009-08-01","endDate":"2011-05-01","gpa":"4.0","courses":["Thesis: 'Polarization modulation for application in terahertz sensing'"]},{"institution":"University of Queensland","area":"Electrical Engineering","studyType":"Bachelor","startDate":"2005-01-01","endDate":"2009-06-01","gpa":"6.2/7","courses":["Honours I","Thesis: 'Polarimetric antenna'"]}],"publications":[{"name":"Enhanced phase detector using nonlinear transmission lines","publisher":"2019 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium (RWS)","releaseDate":"2019-05-16","website":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8714382","summary":"Matthew Dwyer, Aaron Day, Daniel van der Weide"},{"name":"Double-uniform Schottky diode nonlinear transmission line generating sub-picosecond transients","publisher":"2018 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium (RWS)","releaseDate":"2018-03-01","website":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8305012","summary":"Matthew Dwyer, H Kim, L Mawst, Daniel van der Weide"},{"name":"Analysis of half-tapered fiber coupling for microresonators","publisher":"Optics Express","releaseDate":"2017-12-18","website":"https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-25-26-32841","summary":"Atul Bhadkamkar, Matthew Dwyer, Daniel van der Weide"}],"skills":[{"name":"Cleanroom Processing","level":"Master","keywords":["GaAs MMIC","Si CMOS/ISFET","Au air bridge","Custom tooling","Stepper/contact lithography","Metal sputter/evap","Plasma etch/dep","Wet processing","Packaging"]},{"name":"Semiconductor simulation","level":"Intermediate","keywords":["Silvaco","Atlas","Athena"]},{"name":"Microwave/RF simulation","level":"Intermediate","keywords":["CST","Sonnet","ADS","SPICE"]},{"name":"Programming","level":"Intermediate","keywords":["MATLAB","LayoutEditor scripting"]},{"name":"Prototyping","level":"Master","keywords":["CAD/CAM","CNC Machining","Aluminum","PTFE"]}],"interests":[{"name":"Making","keywords":["CNC machining","Carbon fiber composites"]},{"name":"Doing","keywords":["Windsurfing"]}]}
